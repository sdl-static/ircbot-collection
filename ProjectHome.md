## What is this? ##

This is a collection of IRC bots written using Joel Rosdahl's IRC python libraries.  (For more information about these libraries, see the [Python IRC Library](http://python-irclib.sourceforge.net/) project.)

## The Goods ##

  * irclib.py, ircbot.py:  the original IRC library and bot template by Joel Rosdahl <joel@rosdahl.net>
  * wolfbot.py:  the jewel in the crown!  A bot which moderates a game of [Werewolf](http://www.eblong.com/zarf/werewolf.html) in an IRC channel.  (See the README.wolfbot file for instructions.)
  * ifbot.py:  a bot which plays Interactive Fiction into an IRC channel.
  * sussbot.py:  a bot that tries to fool people into thinking it's a distracted/idling human
  * pinkybot.py:  a bot which utters 120+ random phrases from Pinky & The Brain.
  * beanbot.py:  a bot which simply announces messages into a channel
  * bitbot.py:  a bot which pretends to be BIT (from the movie 'Tron')
